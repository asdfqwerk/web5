<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>This is a style sheet that stores the overall style of a web document in advance. It can maintain consistency across documents and reduces the need for detailed styling.
Existing HTML has many limitations in designing and changing web documents from time to time, and it is the style sheet created to complement this and the standard for style sheets is CSS. It is also simply called a style sheet.

When creating a web page using HTML, you need to specify each font in detail in the overall frame, but saving the style (writing format) of the web page changes the contents of the entire page at once, thereby maintaining consistency throughout the document and reducing working time.

Thus, web developers can design the web with a richer design, freely select or change the size of letters, font, line spacing, background color, arrangement location, and make it easier to maintain and repair.
