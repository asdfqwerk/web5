  JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language that is responsible for the behavior of web pages. For example,
   JavaScript allows users to issue commands such as 'Click the button and show the date below'.
  JavaScript allows for rich effects on the web, but until the early 2000s, JavaScript was a language ignored by developers.
   This is because it does not have any functions and its performance was not very good. However, with the creation of a variety of JavaScript frameworks and libraries in recent years,
    the JavaScript ecosystem has expanded significantly, and its status has been increasing.
